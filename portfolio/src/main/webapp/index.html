    <p>I am not a huge fan of photography as I usually forget to take pictures and I love living in the moment. However, at the same time I really enjoy looking back at pictures and reliving through them.</p>
    <p>One of my best friends is a photographer and I always relied on her to take the best pictures, but since we have moved away from each other, now it is my responsibility to take good pictures. Therefore, I recently bought a film camera and have really been enjoying the process of taking pictures on it.</p>
    <p>I think the best thing to photograph is a person's candid profile, like when someone is laughing or looking away because they capture the moment so perfectly and they are also my favourite type of pictures to look back at. 
        I also really enjoy taking pictures of the scenery of wherever I am so that I can always remember the beauty that every unique place in this world holds.</p>
